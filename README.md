# rickandmortyapi-test

RickAndMortyAPI-TEST is a test automation suite created on Python Requests, for a challenge, by R.A.Franza.


## Installation

To make this work, you need the following Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Then, you are able to run the tests inside the main folder, by writing:

```bash
python execute.py
```

## Why you choosed Python?

I tried with different tools, even the suggested (KarateDSL, RestAssured), but finally after a lot of issues with IntelliJ, 
I finally went for the one that I'm learning the most these days, Python Requests. 

## Did I covered all the possible test scenarios?

For sure no, there are still a lot of tests that can be performed using this tool, but, of course it will require a lot more time. 
By the way, I was able to verify the Response body (JSON), as well as Response codes.
